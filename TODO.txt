Some problems with this tmux set up script...

1. Rust directory/file structure uses ../src/main.rs and that would be the EDIT_FILE for each session.

2. So when if want multiple rust tmux attachments it will always connect to the 
   session labeled src-main. 

3. Could manually edit the SESSION_NAME variable and then change the generated filename.
   Must do that or it will default to the first src-main session.

4. Or... could add some code to prompt the user for a SESSION_NAME and that would solve 
   the problem but then its more typing for the user. I just wanted a rapid quick setup for the user.
